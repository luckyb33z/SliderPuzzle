# SliderPuzzle
Unity Slider Puzzle project

This is my first finished Unity project! This is nothing major, but I've been studying Unity and C# for a a few months now. While reading my C# book, I was told to "write a design for a slider puzzle game" -- the book only said to make a design, but since I had been learning Unity as well, I decided to combine my skills and put them together into a single projects.

As of the commit for version 1.0, the code for this project is a bit messy. I would like to review it and do a post-mortem, comparing my original design document with what I wound up doing, as I deviated from the design document as I continued to work on the project.

My work was in C# -- the other languages present in this projected were auto-generated by Unity.
